* @mainpage KarstNSim
*
* @section intro_sec Introduction
*
* KarstNSim is a C++ code for graph-based and geologically-driven simulation of
* 3D karst networks, mainly developed during Augustin Gouy's PhD thesis (2022-2025).
*
* It is highly advised to read the main publication first:
*
* Gouy, A., Collon, P., Bailly-Comte, V., Galin, E., Antoine, C., Thebault, B., & Landrein, P. (2024). KarstNSim:
*  A graph-based method for 3D geologically-driven simulation of karst networks. Journal of Hydrology.
*  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.130878
*
* as well as the PhD thesis (2025).
*
* @section features_sec Usage
* 
* You can find a description of the instruction file parameters in the KarstNSim::ParamsSource struct.
* 
* The most effective way to read the documentation is to go to Files and read the information file by file. Indeed, while most files contain a same name class, some
* files are utility files with helper functions, and some others contain multiple classes, whereas each file has a well defined purpose in the project, making reading
* file by file easier than class by class.
*
* The main order of use of each file is the following (apart from main.cpp and some main classes, header files are cited here for convenience):
*	* main.cpp: main of the project. Creates an instance of the ParseInputs class using its constructor, and uses it to call 'run_simulation_full'.
*	* parse_inputs.h: contains a declaration of the ParseInputs class, which reads the instructions.txt file as well as the supplementary ASCII files and transforms these parameters into C++ objects.
*		+ read_files.h: To easily read other ASCII files (pointsets, TINs, graphs, box), helper functions of this file are used.
*	* run_code.h: contains the main function ('run_simulation_full') used to run KarstNSim, and acts as an interface between the main and the KarsticNetwork class.
*	* karstic_network.h: contains a declaration of the class KarsticNetwork, which stores input parameters and allows to easily set up the karstic network simulation. It then creates an instance of
*     GraphOperations to create the cost graph, and then of KarsticSkeleton to create the karst skeleton and if needed, amplify it. Finally, if required, it simulates sections on the karst skeleton nodes, and saves the outputs.
*		+ geology.h: in addition to the attributes of KarsticNetwork, other more generic parameters are stored in classes representing geological parameters, which are defined in this file.
*		+ ghost_rocks.h: if used, ghost-rocks are taken into account in the KarsticNetwork class during parameter setup through helper functions present in this utility file.
*		+ surface_sampling.h: declares the surface_sampling class used to sample points onto triangulated surfaces vertices, and refine sampling if needed, both are done in KarsticNetwork as part of the parameter setup.
*		+ graph.h: declares various classes representing the cost graph (CostGraph), operations on this cost graph (GraphOperations, inheriting from CostGraph), and the skeleton graph (KarsticSkeleton). The two last ones are
*		 instanced and used inside KarsticNetwork once parameter setup is done. These 3 classes are implemented in 3 separate source files with eponymous file names.
*			- GraphOperations: contains methods allowing to create the sampling cloud, generate the nearest neighbor graph onto it, compute costs for each edge and prune the graph to generate the karstic network.
*			- CostGraph: it is the class representing the nearest neighbor cost graph, notably through the attribute 'adj'. It also contains methods used to update and prune this cost graph (and, notably, Dijkstra algorithms).
*			- KarsticSkeleton: intervenes after GraphOperations and CostGraph. It is the class that represents the simulated karstic skeleton. It contains several methods to update it and amplify it, as well as other operations.
*		+ geostats.h: contains methods used in KarstNSim for equivalent section simulation through 1D-Curvilinear branchwise SGS, if required. It is a 1:1 translation of the code of Frantz et al. (2021), but devoid of any
*		 dependencies (as opposed to the initial version). These methods are called in KarsticNetwork, once the karstic skeleton is simulated.
*		+ write_files.h: also called in KarsticNetwork, it contains helper functions to write down outputs in ASCII format and save them once everything else is done.
*
* Several other utility files are used throughout the code:
*	* vec.h: declares and defines utility classes and functions for simple vector objects (in 2D and 3D), as well as a structure handling KD-tree partitioning and search, through the class PointCloud.
*		+ nanoflann.hpp: header-only library for building KD-Trees, called by the PointCloud class methods.
*	* basics.h: declares and defines various classes representing geometrical objects used for the (hydro)geological model and karst network representation: Segment, Line, Plane, Sphere, Triangle, Surface, Box...
*	* randomgenerator.h: declares utility functions allowing generation of seeds, random numbers and random processes.
*	* simplex_noise.h: declares a SimplexNoise class allowing to generate simplex noise. It was implemented in the code to add noise to the whole cost graph, either for the full simulation, or just for cycle generation.
*	In the end, it was not used nor presented in the 2024 article and the 2025 thesis due to its limited value in the algorithm.
